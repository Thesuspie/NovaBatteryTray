NovaBatteryTray (Experimental)

NovaBatteryTray is a lightweight Windows system tray utility for monitoring the battery status of the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 headset.

It runs silently in the background and displays the current battery level directly in the system tray using dynamic icons, including charging indicators.

⚠️ This is an experimental build. Expect rough edges.
